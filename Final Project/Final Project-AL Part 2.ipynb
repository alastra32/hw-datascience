    "# Project Design Writeup and Approval Template\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow this as a guide to completing the project design writeup. The questions for each section are merely there to suggest what the baseline should cover; be sure to use detail as it will make the project much easier to approach as the class moves on.\n",

    "### Project Problem and Hypothesis\n",
    "* What's the project about? What problem are you solving?   \n",
    "\n",
    "Determine what type of products will customers order according to time of the day using instacart customer order data for 3 Million orders for an unknown time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Where does this seem to reside as a machine learning problem? Are you predicting some continuous number, or predicting a binary value?   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd be trying to predict a binary value. This could also be seen as a classification problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* What kind of impact do you think it could have?   \n",
    "\n",
    "The learnings can be used to predict inventory needs. Moreover, the learnings could also be used to help customers mold or shape their behaviors.\n",

    "\n",
    "* What do you think will have the most impact in predicting the value you are interested in solving for?   \n",
    "\n",

    "### Project Concerns\n",
    "* What questions do you have about your project? What are you not sure you quite yet understand? (The more honest you are about this, the easier your instructors can help).   \n",
    "\n",
    "I am not sure on which regression method or classification method I'll use to determine the solution to my problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the assumptions and caveats to the problem?\n",
    "    * What data do you not have access to but wish you had?   \n",
    "    \n",
    "            An easier classification of the products and not having to heavily relay on the provided product departments to get to conclusions.\n",
    "            \n",
    "    * What is already implied about the observations in your data set? For example, if your primary data set is twitter data, it may not be representative of the whole sample (say, predicting who would win an election)   \n",
    "     \n",
    "          The data only applies to frequent Instacart customers, only customers that have ordered between 4-100 times have been included in the data.\n",
    "* What are the risks to the project?\n",
    "    * What's the cost of your model being wrong? (What's the benefit of your model being right?)   \n",
    "     \n",
    "            The costs of the model being incorrect in the short term is none, in the long term if it were used for inventory needs could lead to monetary impact. If the predictions were used to aid customer behavior, it would result in bad or futile attempts.\n",
    "    * Is any of the data incorrect? Could it be incorrect?   \n",
    "    \n",
    "            The amounts of re-orders above 99 isnt clear, the days since last order gets maxed at 30 and the assumptions for what number is each day of the week may be incorrect.\n",
    "### Outcomes\n",
    "* What do you expect the output to look like?   \n",
    "\n",
    "A function or algorythm that would help predict the classifiction of each order.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What does your target audience expect the output to look like?   \n",
    "\n",
    "A formulated argument with explanations of the findings as well as possible future applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* What gain do you expect from your most important feature on its own?\n",
    "\n",
    "* How complicated does your model have to be?   \n",
    "\n",
    "Not exactly sure, depends on the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How successful does your project have to be in order to be considered a \"success\"?   \n",
    "\n",
    "Success would be that it would correctly classify or predict an order 75% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "* What will you do if the project is a bust (this happens! but it shouldn't here)?   \n",
    "\n",
    "Look for other possible classifications or predictive models based on the available data."
